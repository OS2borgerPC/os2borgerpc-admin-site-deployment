# OS2BorgerPC Admin Site Deployment

This is an experimental deployment setup for the OS2BorgerPC Admin Site. It can be used at your own risk.

## Usage

This setup is currently used in SÃ¸nderborg Kommune, where it is installed on a server that can only be accessed from the local network. There is no internet access to the server.

## Security Considerations

Security considerations for exposing this installation to the internet have not been made. If you plan to expose this setup to the internet, please ensure that you take appropriate security measures to protect the server and the application.

## Docker Compose Setup

The deployment uses Docker Compose to manage the services. Here is an overview of the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

### Services

- **os2borgerpc-admin**: This is the main service running the OS2BorgerPC Admin Site. It uses the image `ghcr.io/os2borgerpc/os2borgerpc-admin-site:7.0.0`. The service is configured to use environment variables from the `.env` file and mounts the `settings.py` file as read-only. It exposes ports `9999` and `8080`.

- **db**: This service runs a PostgreSQL database using the `postgres:latest` image. It is configured to always restart and uses environment variables from the `.env` file. The database data is persisted using the `postgres-data` volume.

- **nginx**: This service runs an Nginx proxy using the `nginx:latest` image. It is configured to handle SSL termination and proxy requests to the `os2borgerpc-admin` service. The Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf`) and SSL certificates (`ssl` directory) are mounted as read-only. The service exposes ports `80` and `443`.

### Volumes

- **admin-media**: This volume is used to store media files for the `os2borgerpc-admin` service.
- **postgres-data**: This volume is used to persist PostgreSQL database data.

### Proxy and SSL Certificates

The Nginx service acts as a reverse proxy for the `os2borgerpc-admin` service. It handles SSL termination and forwards requests to the appropriate backend service. The SSL certificates are stored in the `ssl` directory and are mounted into the Nginx container.
